## Project Overview
This project has been developed as part of the Time Series Analysis course at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano.

The foundation of this work is based on pre-existing code inspired by the paper:
*"Matrix Profile I: All Pairs Similarity Joins for Time Series: A Unifying View That Includes Motifs, Discords and Shapelets"* by Yeh et al.

## Objective
Our goal was to enhance an already well-established algorithm by introducing a customizable parameter v, which allows the computation of the distance profile every v subsequences, rather than at every step. 

## Methodology
We conducted several experiments, including:

Plotting the Matrix Profile
Discovering motifs
These experiments were designed to evaluate the accuracy and behavior of the modified algorithm.

## Modified Components
The following functions were modified:

In **matrixProfile.py**:
            -stmp
            -_matrixProfile

In **utils.py**:
            -mass
            -slidingDotProduct


Additionally, we made changes to the following Jupyter notebooks:

*Matrix_Profile_Tutorial.ipynb*
*Motif_Discovery.ipynb*

In the Motif Discovery notebook, we also implemented a custom function for motif discovery using the stmp algorithm.

## Notes
Other functions were also modified during the development process as part of our exploration, but they were not used in the final implementation.
